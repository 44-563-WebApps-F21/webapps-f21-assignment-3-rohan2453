    <h2>The Black Panther</h2>
    <p2>Black Panther's real name is T'Challa, and he is depicted as the king and protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda.
         Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the 
         essence of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, 
         rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced Wakandan 
         technology to combat his enemies.
